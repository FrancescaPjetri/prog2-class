Note About Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private

and trends in our business;
•fluctuations in our revenues and margins and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
•our expectation that the continuing shift to an online world as the digital economy evolves will continue to 
benefit our business;

our margins;

could affect our overall margins;
•our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;
•fluctuations in paid clicks and cost-per-click as well as impressions and cost-per-impression, and various 
factors contributing to such fluctuations;
•our expectation that we will continue to periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for 
monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and impressions, and for identifying the 
revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity;
•our expectation that our results will be affected by our performance in international markets as users in 
developing economies increasingly come online;

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

management program;

obligations, including our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to

•estimates of our future employee compensation expenses;
•our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OI&E), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely 
driven by market dynamics;
•our expectation that our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years;
•seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends such as 
traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;

contingencies, including the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could harm 
our business, financial condition, and operating results;Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in 
August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. 
("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.
We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that 
provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other 
products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and 
devices.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated 
under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal 
recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of 
the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025 . We have made estimates and assumptions 
that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual 
results could differ materially from these estimates.
These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in 
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024  filed with the SEC.
Recent ly Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 
(ASU) 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to expand the disclosure 
requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the 
rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income 
taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard is effective for our 
2025 annual period and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively . We are currently assessing the effect 
that the updated standard will have on our  financial statement disclosures .
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 "Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)" to improve the disclosures about an entity’s expenses. 
Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain 
expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is 
effective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The 
standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the 
effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.
Prior Period Reclassifications

("Other Americas") .
Revenue Backlog
As of March 31, 2025 , we had $92.4 billion  of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”), primarily 
related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitm ents in customer contracts for future services that 
have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to r ecognize approximatel y 55% of the revenue backlog as 
revenues over the next 24 months  with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog 
and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with 
relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred 
revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with 
an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.
Deferred Revenues
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, 
including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google 
subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024  was $6.0 billion , of which 
$2.6 billion  was recognized as revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 . Total deferred revenue as of 
March 31, 2025  was $6.6 billion .
Note 3.    Financial Instruments
Fair Value Measurements
Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
11
Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets 
or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.
Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we 
use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market 
observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value 
option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to 
align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable 
market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable 
transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities 
that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or 
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment 
are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, 
and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the 
transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the 
rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.
As of March 31, 2025 , the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $48.6 billion , of which 
$25.0 billion  were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2025  and were primarily 
classified withi n Level 2 o f the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Equity Investments
The carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). 
Gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&E in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income. See Note 7  for further details on OI&E.  Certain of our non-marketable equity securities include our 
investments in variable interest entities (VIE) where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 5  for further details 
on VIE.

In the table above, rea lized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period refl ects the difference 
between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the 
purchase date, if later.
Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following 
table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity 
security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period 
of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on 
the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the 
sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

convertible notes  into equity securities, which included g ains from conversion of $416 million . These gains were 
recognized in OI&E  within the Consolidated Statement of Income . See Note 7  for further details on OI&E . 
Derivative Financial Instruments
We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk 
managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, 
earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate 
fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance 
investment returns.
We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the 
derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy 
comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at 
gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.
Cash Flow Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge 
certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These 
contracts have maturities of 24 months  or les s.
Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and 
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points 
and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life 
of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and 
the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.
As of March 31, 2025 , the net accumulated  gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect 
was $151 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.
Fair Value Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our 
marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in 
the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the 
related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize 
changes in the excluded  component in OI&E.
Net Investment Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks 
related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude 
forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in 
OI&E.
Other Derivatives
We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to 
hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting 
hedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and 
liabilities.
We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, 
commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into 
derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising 
from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E. See Note 7  for further details.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Note 5.    Variable Interest Entities
Consolidated VIEs
We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of 
operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. 
For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to 
us. As of December 31, 2024  and March 31, 2025 , assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs 
were $8.7 billion  and $7.8 billion , respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of December 31, 2024  and March 31, 2025 , liabilities for which creditors only 
have recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion  and $2.0 billion , respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing 
operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.
As of December 31, 2024  and March 31, 2025 , total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated 
subsidiaries were $4.2 billion  and $4.4 billion , respectively, of which $1.1 billion  was redeemable noncontrolling 
interests (RNCI) in each period. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to 
noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the "other" component of 
OI&E. See Note 7  for further details on OI&E.
Unconsolidated  VIEs
We have investments in  VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private 
companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve 
power generation using renewable sources .
We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that 
would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results 
of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We 
account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which 
are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of 
these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on t he current carrying value of the investments  and any future 
funding commitments. As of December 31, 2024  and March 31, 2025 , our future funding commitments related to 
unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion  in each period.  
Note 6.    Debt
Short-Term Debt
We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion  through the issuance of commercial paper. 
Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion  and $2.5 billion  of 
commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024  and March 31, 2025 , respectively, with a weighted-average 
effective interest rate o f 4.4%  in each period . The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its 
carrying value as of March 31, 2025 .
Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

Note 10.    Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.6 billion  as 
of March 31, 2025 , of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate 
activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, 
customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have 
agreed to defend and/or indemnify  certain parties  against losses arising from a breach of representations or 
covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these 
agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In 
addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain 
similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification 
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the 
payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the 
future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations or cash flows in a particular period.
As of March 31, 2025 , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably 
possible.
Legal Matters
We record a liability when we believe that it is p robable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be 
reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be 
estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could 
affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible 
losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.
Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial 
changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to 
determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and 
we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal 
matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in 
aggregate, have a material adverse effect.
We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Antitrust Matters
We are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition 
matters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including 
the following:
•Shopping:  In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its 
display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a 
€2.4 billion  fine. In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion  for the fine.
•Android:  In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related 
distribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a €4.3 billion  fine, and directed the 
termination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of 
our Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but 
reduced the fine from €4.3 billion  to €4.1 billion . We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation 
of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a 
charge of $5.1 billion  for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million  in 2022.
•AdSense for Search:  In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's 
agreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws,  imposed a fine of €1.5 
billion , and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented 
25
prior to the decision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion  for the fine and appealed the EC 
decision. In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion  
fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.
•Search:  In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search 
and Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google 
violated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of 
which vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our 
products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our 
distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on 
our business. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We 
expect a decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.
Further, in  June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the 
Japanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.  
In April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android 
agreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary 
penalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order.
    Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible los s.
•Advertising Technology : In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. 
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as 
state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for August 2025 . 
Additionally, in January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the 
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating 
to its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the 
lawsuit. In April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in 
the DOJ case against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google’s advertiser tools or 
acquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google’s publisher tools violated 
antitrust laws by excluding rivals. We  plan  to appeal the adverse portion of this decision.
Further, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that 
Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. In 
September 2024, the UK also issued a Statement of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded.
Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.
•Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for 
the Northern District of California alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. 
antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a 
settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final 
approval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement 
amount to an escrow agent.
In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict  in Epic Games v. Google  finding that Google 
violated U.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The 
presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our 
business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are 
appealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while 
the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration 
of the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.
•European Digital Markets Act:  In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's 
compliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. In March 
2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to which we plan to 
respond in the coming weeks. Given the preliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible 
loss.
In addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims 
pursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions,  including across Europe.  
Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.
26
We believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We 
continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.
Privacy Matters
We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of 
privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations 
and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, 
alleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could 
result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that 
certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in 
these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or 
orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have 
to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss 
of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has 
increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC 
action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important 
market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing 
many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.
Further, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a 
result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.
Other
We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, 
and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related 
compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services 
offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. 
For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such 
claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in 
substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our 
products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or 
other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating 
results.
We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that 
include compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, 
including those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse 
effect.
Non-Income Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. 
The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied 
to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We 
accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax 
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and 
the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity 
and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially 
different from our expectations.
See Note 14  for information regarding income tax contingencies.

Note 11.    Stockholders' Equity  
Share Repurchases
In the three months ended March 31, 2025 , we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a 
manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and 
prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volu mes of the Class A and Class C shares. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 , we repurchased $15.3 billion  of Alphabet's Class A and Class C 
shares.  
In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to  $70.0 billion  of its 
Class A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2025 , $29.5 billion  remained available for Class A and Class C share 
repurchases. In April 2025, the B oard of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an 
additional $70.0 billion  of Class A and Class C shares.
The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

Total share repurchases(1) 83 $ 15,301 
(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases .
Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other 
investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through 
Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
Dividends
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, total cash dividends were  $1.2 billion , $171 million , and $1.1 billion  
for Class A, C lass B , and Class C shares, respectively.
In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21  representing a  5% 
increase from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.20 . The dividend is payable on June 16, 2025 to stockholders of 
record for each of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C shares as of June 9, 2025.
The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the 
company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

For the periods presented above, the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or

Holders of Alphabet unvested stock units are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting 
conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.
Immaterial differences in net income per share across our Class A, Class B, and Class C shares may arise due 
to the allocation of distributed earnings , which is based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the 
allocation of undistributed earnings and number of shares, which is based on the weighted average shares 
outstanding over the periods.

Note 15.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas  
We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:
•Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, 
Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees 
received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, 
and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-ap p purchases ; and devices.
•Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise 
customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions 
received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, 
and other enterprise services.
•Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues 
from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.  
Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering 
activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the 
integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are 
managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to 
operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.
30
Certain costs  are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs 
primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; 
corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human 
resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance 
and office space reductions  are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to 
revenue are not allocated to our segments.
Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses 
segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to 
assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our 
operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS
Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together 
with "Note About Forward-Looking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 , including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors ."
Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results
Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, 
Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further 
details on our segments, see Note 15  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this 
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Revenues and Monetization Metrics  
We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that 
provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other 
products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and 
devices.  For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1  of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2024 .
In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in "Trends in Our 
Business and Financial Effect" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2024 , fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of 
factors, including:
•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer 
incentives;
•general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and 
other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; 
•new product, service, and market launches; and
•seasonality.
Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising ("Google advertising"), other sources 
("Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets have been, and may continue to 
be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.
Google Services
Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and 
devices revenues.
Google Advertising
Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: 
•Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including 
revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search 
in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and 
Google Play;
•YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
•Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, 
AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.
We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our 
advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while 
impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.
32
Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google 
search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google 
Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the 
average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in 
AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based 
revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for 
each impression displayed to users.
As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, 
gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues 
generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.
Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google 
Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties 
and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the 
general factors described above, such as:
•advertiser competition for keywords;
•changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
•changes in device mix;
•seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as 
traditional retail seasonality; and
•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and 
channels.
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:
•consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, 
YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
•platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;
•devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and
•other products and services.
Fluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, 
affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and 
demand, number of subscribers, and the timing of product launches.
Google Cloud
Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:
•Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, 
platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our 
AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud : cybersecurity; and data and analytics;
•Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for 
enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for 
Google Workspace; and 
•other enterprise services.
Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition 
to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.
Other Bets
Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet 
services.
33
Costs and Expenses
Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses 
include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs 
and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components 
of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. 
Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount 
due to factors such as annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.
•TAC includes: 
◦amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and 
services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment 
manufacturers, and software developers; and
◦amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
•Other cost of revenues primarily includes:
◦content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video 
and other content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content 
providers based on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);
◦depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;
◦employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such 
as content review and customer and product support;
◦inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and
◦other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment 
costs.
TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly 
higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, 
because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our 
Google Network partners.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as 
either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.
The main components of our R&D expenses are:
•depreciation;
•employee compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to 
our existing and new products and services; and
•third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our 
engineering and product development efforts.
The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:
•employee compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and 
certain customer service functions; and
•spend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.
The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:
•employee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, 
legal, and other administrative support functions; 
•expenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and 
34
•third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative 
services.
Other Income (Expense), Net 
OI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains 
(losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, 
and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.
For additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations 
in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, 
Item 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur es About Market Risk” in our An nual Report on Form 10-
K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024  as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Provision for Income Taxes  
Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes 
incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve 
provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.
For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, 
Item 8 in our An nual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024  as well as Note 14  of the

Google Services
Google advertising revenues
Google Search & other
Google Search & other revenues increased  $4.5 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the 
three months ended March 31, 2025 . The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in 
search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; 
and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.
YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues increased  $837 million  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 . The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our 
brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.
Google Network
Google Network revenues decreased  $157 million  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 , primarily due  to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates and a 
decrease in Google Ad Manager and AdMob revenues. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in 
AdSense revenues.
Monetization Metrics
The following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks 
and cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a 
percentage, from three months ended March 31, 2024  to three months ended March 31, 2025 :
Google Search & other
Paid clicks change  2 %
Cost-per-click change  7 %
Google Network
Impressions change  (5) %
Cost-per-impression change  4 %
Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in 
advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search 
queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.
Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including 
changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, 
property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenu es increased  $1.6 billion  from the three months ended 
March 31, 2024  to the three months ended March 31, 2025 . The growth was primarily driven by an increase in 
subscription revenues. The increase in subscript ion revenues was primarily due to growth in the number of paid 
subscribers across both YouTube ser vices and Google One.  
Google Cloud
Google Cloud revenues increased  $2.7 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure 
services.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information
International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in 
multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period 
comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues ("constant currency revenues") and non-GAAP 
percentage change in constant currency revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for 
financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe 
the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP r esults helps improve the ability to 
understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of 
our core operating results.
Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant 
period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency 
exchange rate movements ("FX Effect") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated 
level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a 
year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior 
year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.
Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period 
revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are 
translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of 
both periods.
These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with 
GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled 
measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

EMEA revenue growth was unfavorably  affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due 
to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro.
APAC revenue growth was unfavorably  affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due 
to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen , Australian dollar, and South Korean won.
Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably  affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, 
primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real.
Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
The following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):
Three Months Ended
 March 31,
 2024 2025
TAC $ 12,946 $ 13,748 
Other cost of revenues  20,766  22,613 
Total cost of revenues $ 33,712 $ 36,361 
Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  42 %  40 %
Cost of revenues increased  $2.6 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2025  due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1.8 billion  and $802 million , 
respectively. 
The increase  in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months ended March 31, 2025  
was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to 
TAC. The TAC rate decreased  from 21.0%  to 20.6%  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google 
Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three months 
ended March 31, 2024  to the three months ended March 31, 2025  primarily due to increases related to mobile 
searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The 
TAC rate on Google Network revenues  decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.
The increase  in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2025  was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube,  
depreciation expense, and other technical infrastructure operations costs.

Google Services
Google Services operating income increased  $4.8 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the 
three months ended March 31, 2025 . The increase  in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in 
revenues, partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs and TAC. 
Google Cloud

Provision for Income Taxes
The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):
Three Months Ended
March 31,
2024 2025
Income before provision for income taxes $ 28,315 $ 41,789 
Provision for income taxes $ 4,653 $ 7,249 
Effective tax rate  16.4 %  17.3 %
The effecti ve ta x rate increased  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months ended 
March 31, 2025 . This increase was primarily due to lower effective tax rate impacts in the U.S. federal Foreign 
Derived Intangible Income tax deduction , R&D  credits , and  stock-based  compensation-related tax benefit s. 
The OECD  is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus 
around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective 
tax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 202 4, and we expect 
others to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the period ending 
March 31, 2025 .
Financial Condition
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
As of March 31, 2025 , we had $95.3 billion  in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. 
Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid 
government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity 
securities.
Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash 
flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth 
of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital 
return to stockholders.
The following table presents cash flows (in millions):
 Three Months Ended
March 31,
 2024 2025
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 28,848 $ 36,150 
Net cash used in investing activities $ (8,564) $ (16,194) 
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,714) $ (20,201) 
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & 
other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash 
through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we 
generate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and 
other cloud services.
Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network 
partners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities 
include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate 
expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in 
cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses. 
42
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable 
and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and 
non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions .
Net cash used in investing activities increased  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and a decrease 
in maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities. 
The increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driven by investments in technical infrastructure.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from 
the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of 
stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.
Net cash used in financing activities increased  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  due to dividend payments, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance 
of debt, net of repayments.
Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations 
and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for 
investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Capital Expenditures and Leases
We make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property 
and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. 
Capital Expenditures
Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:
•technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, 
storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and 
building construction; and
•office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").
Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including assets in the process of 
construction or assembly, and consists primarily of technical infrastructure.  The time frame from date of purchase to 
placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction 
projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct 
buildings, and secure and install servers and network equipment. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2024  and 2025 , we spent $12.0 billion  and $17.2 billion  on capital 
expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 202 4, our investment in our technical infrastructure, 
including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term 
initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services.  Depreciation of our property and equipment 
commences when such assets are ready for our intended use.  For the three months ended March 31, 2024  and 
2025 , depreciation on property and equipment was $3.4 billion  and $4.5 billion , respectively. 
Leases
As of March 31, 2025 , the amount of total future lease payments under operating and finance leases was 
$17.0 billion  and $2.5 billion , respectively.  
As of March 31, 2025 , we have entered into leases primarily related to data centers that have not yet 
commenced with future lease payments of $17.3 billion . These leases will commence between 2025  and 2031  with 
non-cancelable lease terms between one and 25 years.
43
For additional information on leases, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in 
Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Financing
We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion  through the issuance of commercial paper. 
Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2025 , we had $2.5 billion  
of short-term commercial paper outstanding.
As of March 31, 2025 , we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion .
As of March 31, 2025 , we had $10.0 billion  of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion  expiring in April 2025 and 
$6.0 billion  expiring in April 2028. In April 2025, we entered into a new $4.0 billion  revolving credit facility expiring in 
April 2026. Additionally, we terminated the $6.0 billion  revolving credit facility expiring in April 2028 and entered into 
a new $6.0 billion  revolving credit facility expiring in April 2030. The interest rates for all credit facilities are 
determined based on a formula using certain market rates.  No amounts have been borrowed under the credit 
facilities.
For additional information, see Note 6  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of 
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q .
We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure 
and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then 
supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of 
these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be 
presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly 
Report on Form 10-Q.
Share Repurchase Program
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 , we repurchased and subsequently retired 83 million  shares 
for $15.3 billion .
In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion  of its 
Class A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 2025 , $29.5 billion  remained available for Class A and Class C share 
repurchases. In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an 
additional $70.0 billion  of Class A and Class C shares.
The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025

Dividend Program
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, total cash dividends were  $1.2 billion , $171 million , and $1.1 billion  
for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.
In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21  representing a 5% 
increase from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.20 . The dividend is payable on June 16, 2025 to stockholders of 
record for each of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C shares as of June 9, 2025.  
The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the 
company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

European Commission Fines
In 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European 
competition law and imposed fines of €4.3 billion  ($5.1 billion  as of June 30, 2018 ) and €1.5 billion  ($1.7 billion  as of 
March 20, 2019 ), respectively. 
In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to 
€4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC with the European Court of 
Justice, which remains pending.
In September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. 
The EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice. 
We included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current 
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10  of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Taxes
As of March 31, 2025 , we had income taxes payable of $2.7 billion  related to a one-time transition tax payable 
incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is due in 2025. We also had long-term taxes payable 
of $9.8 billion  primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2025 . 
Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations
As of March 31, 2025 , we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $62.1 
billion , of which $41.5 billion  was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain 
technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements 
related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those 
agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities 
and/or pricing as of March 31, 2025 . In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change 
based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content 
licenses, see Note 10  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report 
on Form 10-Q.
In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and 
energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar 
commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated 
and are not readily determinable.
We may  experience increases in the costs associated with our purchase commitments and other contractual 
obligations as a result of ongoing developments surrounding international trade. For details on risks related to our 
manufacturing and supply chain and other risks,  refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.
Pending Acquisition
In March 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform, for 
$32.0 billion , subject to closing adjustments, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition of Wiz is expected to close in 
2026, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.  For additional 
information, see Note 8  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly 
Report on Form 10-Q.

effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the 
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31,

provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the 
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s 
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter 
ended March 31, 2025  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting. 
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls 
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving 
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that 
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of 
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
