We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for 
applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, 
and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is 
critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.
On April 9, 2025, we were informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of 
our H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 
billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase 
obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially 
anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion 
for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. We were unable to 
ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter. 
GAAP gross margin was 60.5%, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.76.  Excluding the $4.5 
billion charge and related tax impact, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 71.3% 
and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.96.
Revenue
Revenue for the first quarter was $44.1 billion, up 69% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially. 
Data Center revenue for the first quarter was $39.1 billion, up 73% from a year ago and up 10% 
sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our 
accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and 
generative and agentic AI applications. We saw our Blackwell architecture ramp expand to all 
customer categories, while large cloud service providers remained our largest at just under 50% of 
Data Center revenue. Data Center compute revenue was $34.2 billion, up 76% from a year ago and up 
5% sequentially. Networking revenue was $5.0 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 64% 
sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric in our GB200 systems and continued 
adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.
Gaming revenue for the first quarter was a record, up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, 
driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture, the fastest ramp in company history.
Professional Visualization revenue for the first quarter was up 19% from a year ago and flat 
sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by broader adoption of Ada RTX workstation 
GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation.
Automotive revenue for the first quarter was up 72% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially. The 
increase from a year ago was driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.
Gross Margin
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter decreased from a year ago and sequentially, 
primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations 
and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Expenses
GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were up 44% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially, 
and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 43% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially. The year-on-
year increases were primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expenses due to employee 
growth and compensation increases, and compute, infrastructure and engineering development 
costs for new product introductions. The sequential increases were primarily driven by higher 
compensation and benefits due to compensation increases and employee growth.
Other Income & Expense and Income Tax
GAAP other income and expense (OI&E) includes interest income, interest expense, and non-
marketable and publicly-held equity securities gains or losses. Non-GAAP OI&E excludes non-
marketable and publicly-held equity securities gains or losses.
Interest income for the first quarter was $515 million, up from a year ago and sequentially, reflecting 
growth in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Net losses for the first quarter were 
$175 million, driven by losses in publicly-held equity securities, partially offset by gains in non-
marketable securities.
GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 14.3%, an increase from a year ago reflecting a 
lower stock-based compensation tax benefit, partially offset by a higher foreign-derived intangible 
income deduction tax benefit. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.1%.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $53.7 billion, up from $31.4 billion a year ago 
and $43.2 billion a quarter ago. The increases primarily reflect higher revenue partially offset by stock 
repurchases.
Accounts receivable was $22.1 billion with 46 days sales outstanding (DSO), down from 53 days 
sequentially, driven by improved shipment linearity and timing of cash collections.
Inventory was $11.3 billion with 59 days sales of inventory (DSI). Inventory increased from $10.1 
billion, and DSI decreased from 86 days sequentially. Purchase commitments and obligations for 
inventory and manufacturing capacity were $29.8 billion, including new capacity commitments and 
components. Supply and capacity prepayments were $4.2 billion.
Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $13.7 billion, including $10.6 billion of multi-year 
cloud service agreements, down from $14.3 billion sequentially, driven by utilization of our cloud 
service agreements. We expect cloud service agreements to be used to support our research and 
development efforts and our DGX Cloud offerings.
Cash flow from operating activities was $27.4 billion, up from $15.3 billion a year ago and up from 
$16.6 billion a quarter ago. The year-on-year increase reflects higher revenue and timing of cash 
collections. The sequential increase was driven by higher revenue, timing of cash collections, and 
lower cash taxes. We expect a substantial increase in cash taxes in the second quarter related to 
estimated federal and state cash tax payments.
We utilized cash of $14.3 billion towards shareholder returns, including $14.1 billion in share 
repurchases and $244 million in cash dividends.
Second Quarter of Fiscal 2026 Outlook
Outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:
•Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 
revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations. 
•GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72.0%, respectively, plus or 
minus 50 basis points. We are continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the 
mid-70% range late this year.
•GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and 
$4.0 billion, respectively. We expect full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth to be in the 
mid-30% range.
•GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of 
approximately $450 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held 
equity securities.
•GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any 
discrete items.

Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with 
GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. 
These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP 
operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP 
net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s 
investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the 
company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations 
adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, 
acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity 
securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 excess inventory and 
purchase obligation charges, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The 
inclusion of H20 excess inventory and purchase obligation charges in the reconciliations to adjust the 
related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA on April 9, 
2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 products. H20 products were designed 
primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating 
activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal 
payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its 
non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company’s historical 
financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant 
to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in 
accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP 
measures used by other companies.
