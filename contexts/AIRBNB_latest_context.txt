Q1 2025 Shareholder Letter
We had a strong start to 2025. In Q1, guests spent nearly $25 billion on Airbnb. Our results show that 
no matter what’s happening in the world, people continue to choose Airbnb. That’s because our model 
is inherently adaptable. We’ve proven this time and time again, from our founding during the Great 
Recession to going public in the middle of the pandemic. We have millions of homes in neighborhoods 
and cities all over the world. Guests can find stays at every price point, from budget to luxury. And for 
hosts, Airbnb remains an incredible way to earn extra income. As the world changes, we’ll continue 
to adapt. 
Our Q1 results are also a reflection of our focus and discipline. As we’ve shared in recent quarters, we’re 
focused on driving long-term growth and preparing for Airbnb’s next chapter—where we’ll offer more 
than a place to stay. We’ve been laying the groundwork for this transformation for years. We started by 
improving our core service, rolling out hundreds of upgrades that have made Airbnb easier to use, more 
reliable, and more affordable. We introduced features like Guest Favorites to help people easily find the best places to stay, and total price display to give them more transparency around pricing. But improving 
our core service wasn’t enough. To expand beyond homes, we needed an app that could support entirely 
new offerings. So we spent the past few years rebuilding the Airbnb app on a new technology stack. With 
this new platform, we can innovate faster and introduce a range of new businesses in the years ahead.
We’re now ready for what’s next. On May 13, Airbnb will go beyond places to stay. 

4Q1 2025 Financial Results
Here’s a snapshot of our Q1 2025 results: 
 •Q1 revenue was $2.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Revenue increased to $2.3 billion in Q1 
2025 from $2.1 billion in Q1 2024, prim
arily driven by solid growth in nights stayed, partially 
offset by a slight decrease in Average Daily Rate (“ADR”). When you exclude the impact 
of FX and calendar factors (the timing of Easter and the inclusion of Leap Day in Q1 2024), 
revenue would have increased 11%.
 •Q1 net income was $154 million, representing a 7% net income margin. Net income decreased 
to $154 million in Q1 2025 compared to $264 million in Q1 2024, primarily due to higher stock-
based compensation expense largely driven by increased headcount, write-downs of certain 
investments in privately-held companies and lower interest income. 
 •Q1 Adjusted EBITDA was $417 million, representing an 18% Adjusted EBITDA Margin.  
Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $417 million in Q1 2025 from $424 million in Q1 2024 primarily 
due to Q1 2024 revenue benefiting from the calendar factors described above, as well as 
investments in product development in Q1 2025.1
 •Q1 Free Cash Flow was $1.8 billion, representing a FCF Margin of 78%. In Q1 2025, net cash 
provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion compared to $1.9 billion in Q1 2024. This 
decrease in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by the decline in net income. Our 
TTM FCF was $4.4 billion, representing a TTM FCF Margin of 39%.2
 •Q1 share repurchases of $807 million. As of March 31, 2025, we had $11.5 billion of cash 
and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash, as well as $9.2 billion 
of funds held on behalf of guests. Our strong cash flow enabled us to repurchase $807 
million of our Class A common stock in Q1 2025. Share repurchases for the trailing twelve months totaling $3.5 billion helped us reduce our fully diluted share count from 677 million 
at the end of Q1 2024 to 660 million at the end of Q1 2025. As of March 31, 2025, we had the authorization to purchase up to $2.5 billion of our Class A common stock under our current 
share repurchase plan.
Outlook
In Q2 2025, we believe we are positioned to deliver strong results despite recent global economic volatility, 
highlighting the resilience and adaptability of our business. By offering guests a wide range of listings 
around the world and providing hosts economic opportunity, we believe our model can adapt to periods 
of consumer uncertainty.
 •Q2 Revenue.  In Q2 2025, we expec t t o generate revenue of $2.99 billion to $3.05 billion, 
representing year-over-year growth of 9% to 11%. Revenue growth in Q2 2025 includes 
1, 2 A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is provided at the end of this letter.
5a benefit of approximately two percentage points related to the timing of Easter in 2024, 
which cr e
ates a favorable year-over-year comparison during the quarter. As a result, 
we anticipate our implied take rate in Q2 2025 to be higher than in Q2 2024.
 •Q2 Nights Booked and ADR. In Q2 2025, we expect year-over-year growth of Nights and 
Experiences Booked to moderate relative to Q1 2025. During April, we saw strong demand 
for Easter travel from Latin America–which remains our fastest growing region. Whereas 
in the U.S., we’ve seen relatively softer results, which we believe has been largely driven 
by broader economic uncertainties. In Q2 2025, we expect ADR to be approximately flat 
year-over-year.
 •Q2 Adjusted EBITDA. In Q2 2025, we expect Adjusted EBITDA to increase on a year-over-
year basis, but for Adjusted EBITDA Margin to be flat to down slightly compared to Q2 2024. 
Marketing expense is expected to grow faster than revenue on a year-over-year basis in Q2 
2025, partially due to our Summer Release and investments in new growth initiatives.
 •FY Adjusted EBITDA. For full-year 2025, consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to 
deliver a full-year Adjusted EBITDA Margin of at least 34.5%, maintaining our strong track 
record of profitability while making meaningful investments behind future growth levers. 
As shared in our prior shareholder letter, we plan to invest $200 million to $250 million 
towards launching and scaling new businesses in 2025, which we will introduce on May 13. 
We believe that the impact of these investments on our quarterly Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
will be the most pronounced during the second half of the year due to the timing of when 
we introduce these new offerings. We anticipate a more significant contribution to revenue 
growth as these businesses scale over the coming years.
6A CLOSER LOOK
Minor changes, major impact
Even modest improvements can make a big difference to our users. Through thoughtful design and 
iteration, we developed algorithms to make filter recommendations to guests in the booking flow. 
We added contextualized tips to help travelers get even better value and book before time runs out. 
Then we simplified the checkout process so guests wouldn’t miss any steps and can book faster.
Recommended filters
We suggest filters based on what’s 
available, plus the guest’s search and 
booking history, making it easy for 
them to find listings they’ll love.Smarter tips
Guests will now know if the listing’s 
booking window is closing soon or  
if they can access a discount by adding 
an extra night.More intuitive checkout
We used eye tracking and other 
UX research techniques to simplify 
checkout, so guests can book 
homes quicker with fewer drop-offs.

143.1M
Nights & Experiences Booked  
8% Y/ Y$24.5B
Gross Booking Value  
7% Y/ Y  
9% Y/Y (ex-FX)
In Q1 2025, we delivered strong growth of Nights and Experiences Booked of 8% despite the unfavorable 
comparis o
n to Q1 2024, which included Leap Day. Regionally, North America contributes approximately 
30% of our Nights and Experiences Booked, of which the U.S. comprises the vast majority of our business 
in the region. Excluding North America, Nights and Experiences Booked grew 11% year-over-year in 
Q1 2025. 
Growth continued to be driven in part by our app strategy, with nights booked on our app in Q1 2025 
increasing 17% year-over-year. App bookings in Q1 accounted for 58% of total nights booked—up from 
54% in the prior-year period. 
In Q1 2025, GBV was $24.5 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%, or 9% excluding the impact 
of FX. The increase in Nights and Experiences Booked was partially offset by a slight decline in ADR, which 
was impacted by FX headwinds during the quarter. ADR was $171 in Q1 2025, declining 1% compared  
to Q1 2024. Excluding the impact of FX, ADR in Q1 2025 increased 1% and was up across all regions, largely 
due  to price appreciation. 
Travel Trends
During Q1 2025, we saw relatively consistent booking behavior by our guests in terms of market type, 
travel corridor, and length of stay compared to the same prior-year period. Additionally, average lead 
times on the platform during Q1 2025 were generally stable year-over-year.
Geographic Performance
Airbnb is in over 220 countries and regions, and yet the majority of our business is in five countries. 
This represents a significant opportunity for us. While our timing and investment level vary by market, 
our strategy is consistent: make Airbnb local and relevant. In each market, we focus on finding product-
market fit, increasing awareness, and driving traffic. We are excited with the results we have seen so 
far. For the past five quarters, the average growth rate of gross nights booked on an origin basis in our 
expansion markets significantly outperformed our core markets. In fact, the average growth rate was 
more than twice that of our core markets in Q1 2025. Over the coming years, we will continue to prioritize 
our efforts to close the consideration gap and accelerate penetration levels.
 •North America : In Nort h A merica, we saw low-single digits Nights and Experiences Booked 
growth in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. ADR in North America increased 2% in Q1 2025  
8compared to Q1 2024 (or 3% ex-FX), primarily driven by mix shift. Growth in short-term stays 
and entir e h
omes continued to outpace long-term stays (trips of 28 days or more) and Airbnb 
rooms, respectively, helping to drive the mix shift.
In Q1 2025, we continued to see demand grow year-over-year in North America despite broad 
macro uncertainty. The vast majority of nights booked in the U.S. are by domestic travelers 
—only a single-digit percentage of global nights booked are international inbound to the U.S. 
Looking at specific corridors, while we saw softness in travel from Canada to the U.S. during 
the end of Q1 2025, Canadian guests continued to travel on Airbnb. For instance, nights 
booked by Canadian guests to destinations in Mexico increased 27% year-over-year in March. 
Additionally, global year-over-year nights booked from Canadian guests in March was higher 
than in Q4 2024. 
 •EMEA:  In EMEA, we saw mid-single digits Nights and Experiences Booked growth in Q1 2025 
compared to Q1 2024. ADR in EMEA increased 2% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024 (or 4% 
ex-FX), primarily driven by continued price appreciation and mix shift.
 •Latin America:  In Latin America, we saw low-20s Nights and Experiences Booked growth in 
Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. ADR in Latin America declined 7% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 
2024, primarily driven by FX. On an ex-FX basis, ADR increased 2% compared to Q1 2024, due 
to price appreciation.
While we've seen strong results throughout Latin America, Brazil remains one of the fastest 
growing countries in the world on Airbnb. In Brazil, origin nights booked grew 27% in Q1 
2025–an acceleration from Q4 2024. First-time booker growth also picked up sequentially, 
reaching over 30% in Q1 2025. To better meet the needs of our guests in this market, we 
introduced a local payment method last year, Pix, which led to an uplift in bookings and 
first-time bookers. As we continue to expand globally, product localization will remain a key 
priority for each country. 
 •Asia Pacific: In Asia Pacific, we saw mid-teens Nights and Experiences Booked growth in Q1 
2025 compared to Q1 2024. ADR in Asia Pacific declined 1% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024, 
primarily driven by FX. On an ex-FX basis, ADR increased 3% compared to Q1 2024, due to price appreciation. 
Late last year, in order to raise awareness of Airbnb to Japanese travelers, we launched a 
brand campaign centered on domestic travel. While still early, we were encouraged by the results. In Q1 2025, we saw both first-time bookers and domestic nights booked in Japan 
increase double digits with domestic nights growing over 20% year-over-year. 
Supply
Our active listings continued to grow at a healthy pace in Q1 2025, with supply growing approximately 
in-
line with Nights and Experienced Booked. We continued to see growth in both high-density urban and 
non-urban destinations, with the most growth in those regions with the highest demand—Latin America 
and Asia Pacific. Our supply growth strategy is focused on:
9 •Targeted acquisition.  E nsuring we have sufficient supply in supply constrained markets. 
 •Calendar availability.  Helping existing hosts to host more often. For instance, to make it even 
easier, we introduced Co-Host Network last year. Whether it’s setting up a listing, welcoming 
guests, or cleaning, a co-host can help. 
 •Quality listings.  Removing low-quality supply and making it easier for guests to find the best 
places to stay. Since we launched our updated hosting quality system in 2023, we’ve removed 
over 450,000 listings, and have seen a reduction in customer service issue rates and credit card chargeback rates. We also made it easier for guests to find the best places to stay with 
Guest Favorites. Since launch, we have seen over 350 million nights booked at Guest Favorite 
listings. Additionally, in Q1 2025, nights booked at listings managed by Superhosts increased 
15% year-over-year.

We generated $2.3 billion of revenue during Q1 2025, representing a year-over-year increase of 6%. As 
described in our prio r s
hareholder letter, calendar factors, including the timing of Easter and Leap Day 
in Q1 2024, presented a three percentage point headwind to year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2025. 
Additionally, FX contributed to an approximately two percentage point headwind to Q1 2025 revenue. 
Excluding the impact of these calendar factors and FX, revenue would have increased 11%.
Net income in Q1 2025 was $154 mil
lion compared to $264 million in Q1 2024. The year-over-year decline 
in net income was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense largely driven by increased 
headcount, one-time write-downs of certain investments in privately-held companies and lower interest 
income. Net income margin was 7% in Q1 2025 compared to 12% in Q1 2024.
Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2025 of $417 million was down slightly compared to $424 million of Adjusted EBITDA 
in Q1 2024 primarily du
e to Q1 2024 revenue benefiting from the calendar factors described above, as well 
as investments in product development in Q1 2025.3
We generated $1.8 billion of FCF during Q1 2025, highlighting the strength of our cash-generating 
business model. 
Monetization and Take Rate
During Q1 2025, the im
plied take rate (defined as revenue divided by GBV) of 9.3% was flat year-over-year, 
as revenue related to the benefit from the additional service fee amount for cross-currency bookings was 
offset by the timing of Easter in Q1 2024. 
During Q2 2024, we began charging an additional service fee amount for cross-currency bookings. 
The change does not affect the majority of our guests as cross-currency transactions comprise 
approximately 20% of our GBV. In addition, since the introduction of paid guest travel insurance in 2022, 
we’ve been gradually offering it in more countries and now have it available in 12 of our largest countries.

14Balance Sheet and Cash Flows 
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, we reported $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating 
activities and $1.8 billion of FCF, compared to $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, for the three months 
ended March 31, 2024.4
As of March 31, 2025, we had $11.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and 
restricted cash, as well as $9.2 billion of funds held on behalf of guests.
Capital Allocation
During Q1 2025, we repurchased $807 million of our Class A common stock. As of March 31, 2025, we had 
$2.5 billion remaining under our $6 billion repurchase authorization.
The repurchase program continues to be executed as part of our broader capital allocation strategy which 
prioritizes investments in organic growth, strategic acquisitions where relevant, and return of capital to 
shareholders, in that order. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us the 
opportunity to pursue all three capital allocation priorities.
In addition to our share repurchase plan, we often use corporate cash to make required tax payments 
associated with the vesting of employee RSUs, and withhold a corresponding number of shares from 
employees, rather than selling employee shares on their behalf to cover related taxes. Since the inception 
of our share repurchases in Q3 2022, our fully diluted share count has decreased approximately 6%, driven 
in part by our share repurchases and cash used for employee tax obligations totaling $10.3 billion.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the 
United States (“GAAP”), we review financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance 
with GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”). We believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful 
in evaluating our operating performance. We use various non-GAAP financial information, collectively, 
to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that 
non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides 
consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. 
The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should 
not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance 
with GAAP is provided below. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures 
and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP 
financial measures.
Our non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, 
Free Cash Flow Margin, trailing twelve months (“TTM”) Free Cash Flow, TTM Free Cash Flow Margin, 
and revenue change excluding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates (“ex-FX”).
Adjusted EBITDA is define
d as net income or loss adjusted for (i) provision for (benefit from) income 
taxes; (ii) other income (expense), net, and interest income; (iii) depreciation and amortizati
on; (iv) stock-
b
ased compensation expense; (v) acquisition-related impacts consisting of gains (losses) recognized 
on chang
es in the fair value of contingent consideration arrange
ments; (vi) lo
dging taxes for which we 
may have joint and several liability with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, withholding taxes 
on payments made to such hosts, and any related settlements and transactional taxes where there is 
significant ambiguity as to how the taxes apply to our platform; and (
vii) restructuring charges. 
The above items are exclud
ed from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash 
in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core 
results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. 
Reconciliations of expected Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins to corresponding net 
income (loss) and net income (loss) margins have not been provided because of the unpredictability 
of certain of the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and because we cannot determine their 
probable significance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and 
17others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for 
peri
od-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA 
in this letter because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating 
decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing 
strategic planning and annual budgeting. 
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, 
and i
s not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
These limitations include the following: 
 •Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income and other income (expense), net, which 
i
nclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on foreign currency exchange, investments, 
and financial instruments; 
 •Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property 
and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, 
the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted 
EBITDA does not reflect all cash requirements for such replacements or for new capital 
expenditure requirements; 
 •Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue 
to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important 
part of our compensation strategy; 
 •Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition-related impacts consisting of gains (losses) recognized on 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. The contingent consideration, 
which was in the form of equity, was valued as of the acquisition date and is marked-to-market 
at each reporting period based on factors including our stock price; 
 •Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect lodging taxes for which we may have joint and several liability 
with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, withholding taxes on payments made to such 
hosts, and any related settlements and transactional taxes where there is significant ambiguity 
as to how the taxes apply to our platform; and
 •Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect restructuring charges, which include impairment of operating 
lease right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements. 
A
djusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Because of these limitations, 
you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial performance 
measures, including net income (loss) and our other GAAP results.
Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and 
equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is a meaningful indicator of liquidity that provides information 
to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from operations that, after purchases 
of property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives, including continuous investment in 
our business, growth through acquisitions, and strengthening our balance sheet. Our Free Cash Flow 
is impacted by the timing of GBV because we collect our service fees at the time of booking, which is  
18generally before a stay or experience occurs. Funds held on behalf of our hosts and guests and amounts 
pa
yable to our hosts and guests do not impact Free Cash Flow, except interest earned on these funds. 
Free Cash Flow Margin is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by revenue. We track our TTM Free Cash 
Flow to account for the timing difference in when we receive cash from service fees, which is at the time 
of booking. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating 
activities. Free Cash Flow does not reflect our ability to meet future contractual commitments and may  
be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. TTM Free Cash Flow Margin is defined as TTM Free Cash Flow divided by TTM revenue.
In addition to the actual amount or percentage change, we disclose the amount or percentage change 
in our current period results for revenue, GBV, Adjusted EBITDA, and ADR from the corresponding prior 
period results by comparing results using constant currencies. We present constant currency amounts 
and change rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our revenue, GBV, net income 
(loss), Adjusted EBITDA, and ADR performed excluding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
We use the amounts and percentage change in constant currency revenues, GBV, net income (loss), 
Adjusted EBITDA, and ADR for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate 
period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in 
addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation helps improve the ability to understand our performance because 
it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. 
We calculate the percentage change in constant currency by determining the change in the current 
period over the prior comparable period where current period foreign currency amounts are translated 
using the exchange rates of the comparative period.

We track certain key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial 
projections, and make strategic decisions. Our key business metrics include GBV and Nights and 
Experiences Booked. GBV represents the dollar value of bookings on our platform in a period and 
is inclusive of host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations and alterations  
that occurred during that period. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents 
the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for 
experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies that may calculate similarly titled metrics in a different way.

Think outside the hotel
Our “Get an Airbnb” campaign focuses on showcasing the unique advantages of choosing an Airbnb over  
a traditional hotel. Our latest commercial taps into another one of those truths—in a hotel, the world 
beyond your room is limited to the lobby. But in an Airbnb, you can open your door to a forest. For the  
first time, we’ve brought our animated world to life in full-screen, showing how we unlock stays that go 
far beyond four walls. It’s one of the many ways we’re helping more people discover what makes staying  
in an Airbnb so special.
